## Bikesharing: A Tableau Story

New York City has been successful for bike-sharing with Citi Bike. An analysis of the NYC success will be used to assist the decision making process to open a new bike-share business in Des Moines, Iowa. 

[Tableau Public - Citi Bike - Brandon Driver](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brandon.paul.driver/viz/CitiBikeNYC_16559995389450/NYCCitiBike?publish=yes)

Questions answered within the analysis:

- What is the current bicycle usage in NYC? 
- What does Citi Bike's subscriber base compare to one-time users? 
- What demographics are the users made up of? 
- How long are the bikes being checked out for?
- How many trips for all riders for each hour of the week are there?
- How many trips for each type of user and gender of each day of the week are there?

## Results

#### (Figure 1)

![August_Peak_Hours](images/August%20Peak%20Hours.png "Peak Hours")

The peak hours during August for NYC were between 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-7:00 PM. These times match with rush hour, including people using bike-share to get to work.

#### (Figure 2)

![Top Starting Locations](images/Top%20Starting%20Locations.png "Starting Locations")

As shown in figure 2, there is a hih concentration of users starting their trip from Manhattan island. This could be due to tourists.

#### (Figure 3)

![Top Ending Locations](images/Top%20Ending%20Locations.png "Ending Locations")

There is a slightly higher concentration of users ending up in Brooklyn, but most users are staying within Manhattan. 

#### (Figure 4)

![Checkout Times All Users](images/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users.png "Checkout Time All Users")

Users aren't riding for that long, as most trips are less than 15 minutes long. This can also help explain why the starting and ending locations are similar to each other.

#### (Figure 5)

![Checkout Times for Gender](images/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Gender.png "Checkout per Gender")

While all genders checkout for a short duration, men clearly checkout bicycles for longer than females and unknown genders.

#### (Figure 6)

![Trips per Weekday](images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20(Hour).png "Trips(Weekday)")

Using the heatmap in figure 6, its clear that during the week there are more trips during rush hour but during the weekend there are more trips during the afternoon. This is visualized with a 'ring' design within the heatmap.

#### (Figure 7)

![Trips by Gender(Weekly per Hours)](images/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png "Trips by Gender")

Figure 7 shows a similar visualization to figure 6, but showing each gender. With men biking more often and longer, the heatmap is more prominent in the male section.

#### (Figure 8)

![User Trips by Gender](images/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20(weekday).png "User Trips by Gender")

Figure 8 shows that subscribers (again, especially men) are using the bike-share program more than regular daily customers of any gender. In fact, the regular daily customer usage is relatively similar among all genders.

## Summary

![Conclusion](images/70-701569_conclusionu00252bblau-views-emo.png "Conclusion")

Male subscribers make the majority of Citi Bike users in NYC. Women and other genders utilize the service less often, at least in the NYC market. There is no reason to believe this to be much different in Des Moines.

Usage during the week parallels with rush hour and commuters. Usage during the weekend peaks during the afternoon. All riders generally take trips shorter than 15 minutes in duration. The amount of stations and their placement would not need to be across the entire city; they could be integrated in the downtown area with ancillary stations.


### Suggestions

The first suggestion for an additional visualization would be to focus on age of users while filtering gender. This would give another insight into the demographics of riders. This visualization could assist in marketing strategy or to decide where to station bicycles.

The second suggestion is to determine to top used station IDs (both starting and ending) with total user count data to determine which of the top used stations are. This could help decide where to place stations in a new developing city. Would it be better to put it by a business park for commuters or public transportation like a bus/train stop?
